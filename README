ActionMedia
===========

Simple said, this creates a nice way to easily include javascript and stylesheets. 
We all know that javascript and css should be broken up per page, and i've been using this
for a while to easily load css/js which is page specific. 

The plugin will look to make sure the file exists before trying to load it, so you won't have 404's when
the file doesn't exist. 

In short, for a given action belonging to a controller it will try load the associated css and js files. 

Example
=======

In your layout file (or whever you have your head tags) add
<%= controller_action_stylesheet %> 
<%= controller_action_javascripts %>

For :controller => "posts", :action => "index" it would generate (only if the files exist)
<%= stylesheet_link_tag '/posts/index.css' %>
<%= javascript_include_tag '/posts/index.js' %>

Simple enough?
